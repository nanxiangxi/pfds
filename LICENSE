“作品”是指在许可证下提供的作品，无论是源代码形式还是对象形式，均应包含版权声明（下面提供了示例）。

“衍生作品”是指基于（或衍生自）作品并以编辑修订、注释、扩展或其他修改为代表的作品，整体上构成原创作品。为了本许可的目的，衍生作品不包括与作品及其衍生作品保持分离或仅仅链接（或通过名称绑定）到作品接口的作品。

“贡献”是指有意提交给许可方供包含在作品中的任何作者作品，包括作品的原始版本及其任何修改或添加。为了本定义的目的，“提交”是指任何形式的电子、口头或书面通信发送给许可方或其代表，包括但不限于通信在电子邮件列表、源代码控制系统和问题跟踪系统中进行，这些系统由许可方或代表许可方管理，用于讨论和改进作品，但不包括版权拥有者明确标记或书面指定为“非贡献”的通信。

“贡献者”是指许可方以及任何向许可方提交贡献并随后纳入作品中的个人或法律实体。

版权许可授予。

根据本许可的条款和条件，每位贡献者在此授予您永久、全球性、非独占、无费用、免版税、不可撤销的版权许可，以复制、准备衍生作品、公开展示、公开表演、再许可和分发作品及其衍生作品，无论是源代码形式还是对象形式。

专利许可授予。

根据本许可的条款和条件，每位贡献者在此授予您永久、全球性、非独占、无费用、免版税、不可撤销（如本节所述）的专利许可，以制造、委托制造、使用、提供销售、销售、进口和以其他方式转让作品，其中该许可仅适用于因贡献者的贡献单独或与其贡献组合而必然侵犯的可授权专利索赔。如果您提起针对任何实体（包括反诉或反诉在诉讼中）的专利侵权诉讼，声称作品或包含在作品中的贡献构成直接或间接专利侵权，则本许可授予您的关于该作品的任何专利许可将在提起诉讼之日终止。

重新分发。

您可以复制和分发作品或衍生作品的副本，无论是否进行了修改，并且可以是源代码形式或对象形式，前提是您满足以下条件：

(a) 您必须向作品或衍生作品的其他接收者提供本许可的副本；并且

(b) 您必须使修改后的文件带有显著的通知，声明您修改了文件；并且

(c) 您必须在分发的任何衍生作品的源代码形式中保留所有版权、专利、商标和归属通知，除非这些通知与衍生作品无关；并且

(d) 如果作品包含一个“NOTICE”文本文件作为其分发的一部分，则任何您分发的衍生作品必须包含一个可读的副本，该副本包含上述NOTICE文件中的归属通知，除非这些通知与衍生作品无关，在以下位置之一：作为衍生作品的一部分分发的NOTICE文本文件内；如果与衍生作品一起提供源代码或文档，则在源代码或文档内；或者，在衍生作品生成的显示中，如果并且在第三方通知通常出现的地方。NOTICE文件的内容仅供信息用途，并不修改本许可。您可以将您自己的归属通知添加到您分发的衍生作品中，作为NOTICE文本文件的补充或附录，前提是这些附加的归属通知不能被视为修改本许可。

您可以将您自己的版权声明添加到您的修改中，并可以为您的修改或衍生作品的整体提供额外或不同的许可条款和条件，前提是您对作品的使用、复制和分发符合本许可规定的条件。

贡献提交。

除非您明确声明，否则您有意提交给许可方以包含在作品中的任何贡献都应遵守本许可的条款和条件，没有额外的条款或条件。尽管上述规定，本协议中的任何内容均不得取代或修改您可能已经执行的任何单独许可协议中有关此类贡献的规定。

商标。

本许可不授予使用许可方的贸易名称、商标、服务标志或产品名称的权限，除非出于合理和惯常的方式描述作品的起源和复制NOTICE文件的内容所需。

免责声明。

除非适用法律要求或书面同意，许可方（每个贡献者提供其贡献）均按“现状”提供作品（和每个贡献者的贡献），没有任何明示或暗示的保证或条件，包括但不限于任何关于标题、非侵权、适销性或特定用途适用性的保证或条件。您独自负责确定使用或重新分发作品的适当性，并承担与此相关的任何风险。

责任限制。

在任何法律理论下，无论是在侵权（包括过失）、合同或其他情况下，除非适用法律（例如故意和重大过失行为）或书面同意，任何贡献者均不对您因本许可或因使用或无法使用作品而产生的损害承担责任，包括但不限于任何直接、间接、特殊、附带或后果性损害（包括但不限于商誉损失、工作停止、计算机故障或故障以及所有其他商业损害或损失），即使该贡献者已被告知发生此类损害的可能性。

接受保修或额外责任。

在重新分发作品或衍生作品时，您可以选择提供，并收取支持、保修、赔偿或其他法律责任和/或权利的费用，前提是这些义务和权利与本许可一致。但是，在接受此类义务时，您只能以您自己的名义和责任行事，而不是代表任何其他贡献者，并且只有在您同意赔偿、辩护并将每个贡献者免于因您接受任何此类保修或额外责任而导致的责任或索赔时才可如此。

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
